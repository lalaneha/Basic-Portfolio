        I was born in Sunnyside Queens, New York City, NY. My parents moved me to washington state when I was one years old and I have been here ever since. I was raised in a small city called Marysville.
        I love hiking and enjoying the beautiful views in the Pacific Northwest.

        I have a cute little Chihuahua/Dashound dog that loves to cuddle with me on the sofa. We love to watch netflix and chill together!

        My favorite sports are basketball and volleyball. I have a younger brother who is always down to play a one on one game of ball with me!
